## Audience / User Roles:
Our ideal users are people with roommates. There are two different types of users, the user who bought the items and took the picture of the receipt and the users who got 
certain items but didn't pay yet. For short receipts, the person who took the picture will be able to drag items on the receipt to the names of the person who bought that item. For long 
receipts, the app will generate a QR code that other people can scan and access the receipt and then drag their own items. The goal for this app is to settle debts, and the app accomplishes 
this goal by accurately splitting the cost of the receipt.

## MVP Expanded Description:
Take a picture(s) of a receipt and upload it into the app. Once uploaded, the user will be able to create as many baskets as they need, and each basket will represent someone that the user shopped with. Then, the user will be able to drag each item on the receipt to the respective basket of the person who bought that item. Once all items have been dragged, the total cost of the items in each basket will be calculated.
