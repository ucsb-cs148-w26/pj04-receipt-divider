## Audience / User Roles:
Our ideal users are people with roommates. There are two different types of users, the user who bought the items and took the picture of the receipt (**Shopper**) and the users who got 
certain items but didn't pay yet (**Friend**). For short receipts, the person who took the picture will be able to drag items on the receipt to the names of the person who bought that item. For long receipts, the app will generate a QR code that other people can scan and access the receipt and then drag their own items. The goal for this app is to settle debts, and the app accomplishes this goal by accurately splitting the cost of the receipt.

## App Type:
Our main focus is iOS, and then Web and Android afterwards.

## Framework / Tech Stack: 
- React Native because it's for both IOS, Android, and the web. 
- Expo
- Firebase database to store data - no sql, FREE.

## MVP Expanded Description:
Take a picture(s) of a receipt and upload it into the app. Once uploaded, the user will be able to create as many baskets as they need, 
and each basket will represent someone that the user shopped with. Then, the user will be able to drag each item on the receipt to the respective basket 
of the person who bought that item. Once all items have been dragged, the total cost of the items in each basket will be calculated.

## Dependencies
TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

## Installation Steps
TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch). Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with act, you can run GitHub Actions locally).
