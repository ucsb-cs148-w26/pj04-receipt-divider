## Sprint planning:  
We are planning a 2 week sprint in which will focus on identifying some basic functionalities of the app that we want to implement. We all are going to get more familiar with react native and identify some features that we want to work on. In future scrum meetings we will further discuss the how we want to design the app and assign issues to individual members. 

For specific implementation, by the end of the sprint we will work on getting some basic app features likea home page, app page framework, vision scanning, etc.

We will have set code reviewers whose job it is to persuse the pull requests periodically, review the code and then merge into our main. 
Charlie: week 3 code reviewer  
Mason: week 4 code reviewer

Don't commit to main and create your own feature branch before opening a pull request. 
Try and keep clean code messages and commit messages. Make sure you get someone to review your code before your feature gets merged into main.
