# Problem Scenario:
Johnny Smith is a University of Californa, Santa Barbara student. He lives off campus and thus needs to shop for his own groceries. Since Johnny does not have a Costco membership but his friends do, he goes shopping at Costco with them. At checkout Johnny has two decisions, buy the items with his friends or buy the items seperately and risk getting kicked out (you are not allowed to scan your card for anyone else.) If Johnny chooses the former, he and his friends are left with a long reciept and have to manually split the bill. Johnny wishes there was a way for the bill to be split easier and totaled up quicker!
