My name is Edward Garcia and I am a fourth year CS student. For this project some possible extra ideas I would like to add would be to have a log of past bills and to possibly integrate LLM functionality. Also working on mobile integration and implementing built in camera functionality to easily read receipts with computer vision techniques. For the tech stack, I think react native would work but I am open to other ideas. I'm excited to work with you all this quarter!

To run my hello world app follow these steps:

Install node.js (latest LTS)
Ensure "node -v" and "npm -v" return some version

Type "cd rn-hello-world" in cli

Type "npx expo start" in cli

Press 'i' to start simulator
