My name is Edward Garcia and I am a fourth year CS student. For this project some possible extra ideas I would like to add would be to a ve a log of past bills and to possibly integrate LLM functionality. Also working on mobile integration and implementing built in camera functionality to easily read receipts with computer vision techniques. I'm excited to work with you all this quarter!
