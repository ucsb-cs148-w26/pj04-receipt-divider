Hi! I'm a third year CS major, currently looking for a job 😭. In my free time you can catch me cooking, traveling, and doom scrolling.

For the project, I think we can go with an mobile app that allows users to conveniently join a receipt to add their item. The tech stack I think we should go with React Native with, a FastAPI backend, and somesort of NoSQL database.
