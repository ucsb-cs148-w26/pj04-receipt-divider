My name is Roy Lee and I'm a sophomore CS major. 

For this project, I'm thinking of an app that allows the user to take a picture of a receipt and then drag each individual item on the receipt over a name, showing that that person was the one who got that item. After going through all items, the total cost each person must pay is calculated and shown.
