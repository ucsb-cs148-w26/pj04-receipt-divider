# User Feedback Needs

## Overview

As we continue developing our Receipt Divider app, we've identified three critical areas where user feedback would significantly inform our product development decisions and improve the overall user experience.

## 1. User Interface Design & Visual Appeal

**Focus Area**: Friendly and approachable UI design

**What we want to learn**:
- How users perceive the visual friendliness and approachability of our current interface
- Whether our color scheme, typography, and visual hierarchy feel welcoming and professional
- User preferences on visual elements like icons, button styles, and overall aesthetic

## 2. User Experience & Interface Intuitiveness

**Focus Area**: Ease of use and logical app flow

**What we want to learn**:
- Whether users can complete key tasks without guidance or confusion
- Pain points in navigation and feature discovery
- Time-to-completion for typical receipt splitting scenarios
- User mental models vs. our app's information architecture

## 3. Product Usefulness & Feature Prioritization

**Focus Area**: Real-world utility and feature demand

**What we want to learn**:
- Whether users would actually adopt and regularly use the app in real scenarios
- How well our app solves their receipt splitting pain points compared to current methods
- What additional features would make the app more valuable to them
- User willingness to recommend the app to friends/family
