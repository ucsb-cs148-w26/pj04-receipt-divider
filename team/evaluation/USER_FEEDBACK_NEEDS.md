## Metric

**Team Metric**: Receipt split success rate:
* Percent of testers who are confident they could complete a full receipt split without help (a score of 4 or 5)
* Estimated completion time of a receipt with 3 people and 10 items being less than 5 minutes

Why it represents user value: It captures the core promise of the app (fast, low-friction receipt splitting) and ties directly to first-time success.

**How to test in class**:

1. Show the app description at the top of the form.
2. Let the tester try out the app with a provided receipt.
3. Ask the confidence question (Q1).
4. Ask the time-to-complete scenario question (Q2).
5. Ask the remaining experience and usefulness questions (Q3-Q7).

**What to record**: Confidence rating + time bucket; compute the % who meet both success criteria.

**Success definition**: 90% of testers meet both criteria.

**Target for Wednesday**: 50% of testers meet both criteria.
