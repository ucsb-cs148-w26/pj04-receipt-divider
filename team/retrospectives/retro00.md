# **CS 148 Retrospective 00**

| Team | 4 |
| :---- | :---- |
| Date of Retrospective | 1/23/25 |
| Retro Leader | Charlie Nava |

The purpose is to identify team practices that need to either *stop, start, or continue* in the team. Your observations can focus on (but not limited to) the following areas:

| Concern | Example Practices |
| :---- | :---- |
| Collaboration | Pair programming, standups,  |
| Communication | Chat frequency, response time, status updates |
| Coding/Technical Operations | Development, devOps, git and workflow |
| Learning | Technical knowledge, help requests, strategies |
| Camaraderie | Social activities e.g., wordle |

In the first step of the retro, you'll be asked to reflect on practices that your team should start, stop, or continue**.** The intent is that each person works privately on their own list of stop/start/continue items 

As an example, your list might include these:

* We need to **stop** creating one pull request for multiple issues so that our code reviews are more efficient.  
* We need to **start** asking staff and team members questions earlier so that we have more clarity on how to proceed with the assignment and are able to finish on time  
* We should **continue** sharing resources and asking for help when we are stuck so that we can all make good progress on our tasks.

# **Part 1 : Collecting items for the current retro**

Collect the ‘stop/start/continue’ items for this retro.  There is a place for each team member; the order is unimportant.  Put your name in the first available space, and start copying your items into the table.

Please format the items as tables, as shown below:

**Team member example:** 

| Stop / Start / Continue | Action | Rationale | Votes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| *Start* | We need to **start** asking staff and team members questions earlier finish on time | **so that** we have more clarity on how to proceed with the assignment and are able to |  |
| *Continue* | We should **continue** sharing resources and asking for help when we are stuck |  **so that** we can all make good progress on our tasks |   |

**Team member 1:  Name: Charlie Nava**

You may add rows if needed

| Stop / Start / Continue | Action | Rationale | Votes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Stop* |  |  |  |
| *Start* | Announcing any major decisions and actions in the group chat and creating a formal written record of it | With everyone working largely asynchronously, it can be difficult to get everyone to understand the direction of the project, so making formal declarations records can help in helping everyone get on the track | xx |
| *Continue* | The scheduled PR person system | It is a fair system that makes it so everyone pitches in and provides a bit of necessary pressure to engage with the team | x |
|  |  |  |  |

**Team member 2:  Name: Ken Thampiratwong**

You may add rows if needed

| Stop / Start / Continue | Action | Rationale | Votes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Stop* | We need to **stop** putting our names on branches | The branches shouldn’t be specific to a person, but rather a feature or bug fixes. This prevents multiple branches with the same features when multiple people work on the same thing. | x |
| *Start* | We need to **start** writing acceptance criteria for each tickets | This would clearly outline the goal and what features we can expect from a ticket. | xxxxx |
| *Continue* | We should **continue** making small tickets | This divides our work into sizable chunks. Improving our async workflow. | x  |

**Team member 3:  Name: Roy Lee**

You may add rows if needed

| Stop / Start / Continue | Action | Rationale | Votes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Stop* | ***Stop** nothing.* | I feel like everything is going well, I don’t think there are any glaring issues. |  |
| *Start* | ***Start** being more vocal about which issue you’re picking up.* | I think it’s good to let the team know to get a better understanding of how the app development is going. | xxxxx |
| *Continue* | ***Continue** the good team environment and morale.* | I like the way the team interacts and I feel like everyone is having a good time. Happy team \= better results. |   |
|  |  |  |  |

**Team member 4:  Name: Edward Garcia**

You may add rows if needed

| Stop / Start / Continue | Action | Rationale | Votes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Stop* | **Stop** staying silent if you need help or suggestions | If you need help, then ask for it because your team members might have the solution | x |
| *Start* | *We should **start** notifying the team in the group chat when you open a PR or if you see an issue with a current PR.* | This will help speed up PR’s so that we can avoid having a lot of them open at once |  |
| *Continue* | ***Continue** to have a team that is open to other members suggestions and ideas* | I like that all the team members are open to new ideas since it creates a welcoming environment | xx  |

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| *stop* | *Stop thinking 1 week is long enough for a MVP* | So we will be more efficient |  |
| *continue* | *Put effort on our work* | So we can finish the MVP |   |

# **Part 2: Dot vote on the items**

After completing all parts, each member of the team should put three x marks (your votes) beside the items (from any of the team members) that you think are the most important for the team to discuss.  You may:

* distribute your votes across three items  
* put two votes on one item, and one on another  
* put all three votes on one item

# **Part 3: Discussion of Current Items**

Next, locate the top three items from stop/start/continue for the current retro and have a discussion


The retro leader should look for rows that are duplicates, and if the team consents, merge the votes.  
Then the retro leader should look for the three rows that have the most votes.  In the event of a tie, the retro leader can make a tie breaking vote.

Then,  copy/paste each of the three "winning" rows (the ones with the most votes) into the three tables below:

In your discussions, try to rely on logical reasoning, data, and observations.  You may consider including an analysis of pros/cons of stopping/starting/continuing this item.  You might also include a discussion of alternative strategies for achieving the same goal.

# # Retro Assessment 
Description: 

For this retro, I, Charlie, chose the stop/start/continue outline. The outline asks all the participants to come up with 3 items, one that you want the team to start doing, one that you want the team to stop doing, and one item that you want the team to continue doing. We then picked the 3 most popular items, regardless of type, and discussed their benefits, cost, and implementation. 

Assessment: 

I think we overall had a good retro. We went through the process fully and agreed on some changes. However, we rushed the retro in the later parts, due to time constraints. 

Advice:

If you choose to do this retro format, then you should be prepared to help your members come up with ideas. Try to remind them of different scenarios where they could get inspiration. It is important that you get everyone to get engaged with coming up with items, since this is the core of the format. 

## Experiemnt/Change
Description: 

After this retrospective, our team will implement three main changes. First, we will begin writing clear acceptance criteria for every ticket, so that each task has well-defined goals and expectations before work begins. Second, team members will be more vocal about which issues they are picking up. Finally, we will adopt conventional commits for all future commits. This will standardize our commit messages, making the project history easier to understand, debug, and maintain over time. 

We will measure our progress by taking a sample size of our commits, announcements, and tickets, and then comparing them to a criteria that the team agreed on.
