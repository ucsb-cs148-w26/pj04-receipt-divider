# **Part 1 : Assessment of previous retro**

| Action | Assessment: *did we accomplish the action?* |
| :---: | ----- |
| We need to start writing acceptance criteria for each ticket | Not really Accomplished For more complicated issues / User stories  Less Vague, clear goal No redundancy **Write acceptance criteria for every issue except straightforward ones OR break larger issues down into small enough issues**  |
| Start being more vocal about which issue you’re picking up |  Assign yourself to any issue you’re working on  |
| Using conventional commits | Mostly solved  |

# **Part 2 : Collecting items for the current retro**

The purpose is to identify team practices that need to either *stop, start, or continue* in the team.   
As an example, your list might include these:

* We need to **stop** creating one pull request for multiple issues so that our code reviews are more efficient.  
* We need to **start** asking staff and team members questions earlier so that we have more clarity on how to proceed with the assignment and are able to finish on time  
* We should **continue** sharing resources and asking for help when we are stuck so that we can all make good progress on our tasks.

| Team Member | Type: choose one: *start*, *stop*, *continue* | Action: *what should be done* | Rationale: *why it should be done* | Votes |
| :---: | :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| YiHeng Feng | continue | Shopping at costco |  |  |
| Edward Garcia | start | Doing code explanations for more complicated pull requests. Doesn’t need to be an overly complicated explanation, just brief enough to get a basic understanding. | To help code reviewers understand your code and so that other team members can understand new code | xxxx |
| Roy Lee | start | Let people know what issue you’re currently working on and provide a rough estimate on when it will be completed | Lets the group know the current progress of the project and gives a rough idea of how its going over all, also some issues need prior issues to be completed before they can be started.. | xxx |
| Ken T. | stop | We should stop making tickets that can’t be resolved through coding. (Ex: learn, research, or scope out). | Tickets should only be used for evolving the codebase. Moreover, they clog up the Kanban board, making it harder to go through actual tickets. | xxxx |
| Mason Le | N/A |  LOL |  | xxxxxx |
| Charlie Nava |  |  |  |  |
| Leifeng Chen | start | We need to start writing acceptance criteria for each ticket  | Give a clear understanding of what we need to do for each task/feature | xx |

# **Part 3: Vote for 3 items**

After completing all parts, each member of the team should put three x marks (your votes) beside the items that you think are the most important for the team to discuss. You may put multiple votes on one item.

# 

# **Part 4: Discussion of Voted Items**

Next, locate the top three items, and have a discussion.

### **Discussion item 1:**

| Type | Action | Rationale |
| :---: | ----- | ----- |
| N/A |  LOL |  |

| Pros |   |
| :---: | :---- |
| **Cons** |   |
| **Ways to measure** | Do less retros  |

### **Discussion item 2:**

| Type | Action | Rationale |
| :---: | ----- | ----- |
| start | Doing code explanations for more complicated pull requests. Doesn’t need to be an overly complicated explanation, just brief enough to get a basic understanding. | To help code reviewers understand your code and so that other team members can understand new code |

| Pros |   |

### **Discussion item 3:**

| stop | We should stop making tickets that can’t be resolved through coding. (Ex: learn, research, or scope out). | Tickets should only be used for evolving the codebase. Moreover, they clog up the Kanban board, making it harder to go through actual tickets. |

| Pros |   |
| :---: | :---- |
| **Cons** |   |
| **Ways to measure** |   |

| Keep our Kanban board clean (not too many things on there) Keep User Stories & Sub-issues on Kanban board Have bigger sub-issues with acceptance criteria Sub-sub-issues should not be on the Kanban board Acceptance criteria should be shorter  |
