# User Journey:

## Background
College students frequently shop for groceries with friends or roommates. Sometimes they lack store memberships, and often one person pays upfront for the group.

## Context
After a group grocery trip, the student needs to fairly and quickly split a single receipt among multiple people.

## Beginning
- The group shops together and places everyone’s items in a shared cart.
- At checkout, one person pays the full bill (either due to store rules, convenience, or membership restrictions).
- The group receives a long receipt with many items and unclear item names.
- The payer becomes responsible for splitting the total cost.

## Using Our App
- The receipt is uploaded or scanned into a receipt-splitting app.
- The app automatically extracts item names and prices.
- Items appear in a shared digital list.
- Each participant is invited to the session.
- Participants drag their items into their own digital baskets (or the payer assigns items).

## End
- The app automatically calculates each person’s total.
- Everyone can see their own basket and total in real time.

The group splits the bill quickly, accurately, and stress-free. No one overpays, no one underpays, and the social friction of group shopping disappears.
